# neotrellis-macroboard


Use the Adafruit NeoTrellis M4 as a macropad by installing [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/board/trellis_m4_express/) and [KMK](https://kmkfw.io/). The current keymap is for navigating in Sway, Firefox and MPV.

LEDs (neopixels) do work but have been disabled because they are a bit glitchy. See comment in kb.py to enable.

This is probably more of a novelty than useful tool. Startup time is quite slow so expect to wait 10 second or more after plugging it in but it works well after booted.
